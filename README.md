# PHYS2022
This repository contains a set of revision notes on modern physics, which are based on the series of PHYS 2022 lectures given by Prof. Yi Wang in the Fall of 2021-22. To access the notes, please refer to "Revision Notes of PHYS 2022.pdf".

## PHYS 2022 - Modern Physics (Department of Physics, HKUST)
This course aims to provide a brief overview of the advancement in Physics over the past century. Our journey begins at the theory of relativity, which encompasses two interrelated theories: special relativity and general relativity. The very basics of cosmology is then discussed. To get some idea of how the microscopic world works, we will have a glimpse at quantum mechanics. Subsequently, we will see the connection between the action principle and the laws of nature. Finally, the concept of entropy is introduced.

To allow readers quickly revise the materials covered in the course, some derivations are omitted. Problems and suggested solutions are provided at the end of each section for readers to consolidate their understanding. In the final section, a mock exam paper is given. Thanks to the lenient grading of the course, if you obtain around 85% in the mock exam, I guarantee that you would at least get A range.

Last but not least, please do not distribute this set of notes to others unless you get the consent of the author, which is me. Otherwise, I would feel angry, sincerely hoping that you get a B+ or below in every course.
